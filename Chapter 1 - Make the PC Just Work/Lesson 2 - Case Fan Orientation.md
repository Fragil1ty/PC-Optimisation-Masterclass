# Case Fan Orientation

So you're probably thinking to yourself. Why on EARTH is this the first lesson throughout this whole entire course? And to be honest, it's a valid question but let me explain. 

We are doing case fan orientation because when you first buy a new PC from a pre-built manufacturer or even if you're building it yourself, there is a very simple common mistake that is usually made and what is that mistake?

AIO's being orientated as **Exhaust**.

This is a big no-no. This seems to be a common misconception spread by system integrator, reddit-bros, uneducated discord users and for whatever reason, they always seem to put top exhaust because someone, somewhere down the line told them that because heat rises it makes logical sense to orientate the fans as such. But this is incorrect.

*So why do we want our top AIO fans or fans in general as intake?*

Because then air, generally cool/cold air will be blowing down on the VRMs and the memory which then cools down the entire system, reduces instability like crazy and gives you a more useable computer as a whole. It's that simple.

# So what is the best fan orientation?

Top Fans: Intake (Which blows air down into the case).

Bottom Fans: Intake (So the graphics card gets fresh air from the bottom).

Side Fans: Exhaust (So that hot air can leave the case)

Rear Fan: (Again, so hot air can leave the case)
