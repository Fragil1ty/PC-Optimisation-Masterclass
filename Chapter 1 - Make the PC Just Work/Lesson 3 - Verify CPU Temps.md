# Verify your temperatures

Why is this lesson next? I cannot tell you how many consults I have done, how many individuals I have spoken to where their CPU is idling at 60c and then they launch a game and it's shooting up to 80/85c, they're getting thermally throttled and then they wonder a few months later. "Why is my CPU degraded?" and this is why. CPU temperatures are VERY important. 

# What are common causes of high CPU temperatures?

- Builders leaving the cover sticker on their new AIO heatsink
- Poor thermal paste spread
- Wrong fan orientation
- Using wrong standoffs

We want to make sure that we are getting our temperatures to a manageable level before anything else because if we have bad CPU temperatures, bad VRM temperatures, bad RAM temperatures, bad GPU temperatures, it's just going to make the optimisation pointless. 

# Step 1: Enter the BIOS

How to do you know if you have bad contact? Well, once you enter the BIOS, the temperatures will slowly climb. It'll start at 40c, then 42c, then 44c, then 48c and so on and this is a sign that your CPU is not properly mounted and/or not properly seated and this is what is causing those fluctuations in temperature and you want to address this immediately.
