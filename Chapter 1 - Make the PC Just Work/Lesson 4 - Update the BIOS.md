# Updating your BIOS

This one can be skipped by a lot of people, it's very straight-forward and a lot of people have already done this long before even looking at optimisation packages, scripts and so on. 

# So how do I update my BIOS?

1: You're going to need a USB penstick. Now, can it be done without this? using different partitions on a different hard-drive? Sure, but this is just much safer, less prone to failure and less prone to bricking your motherboard but don't be alarmed, flashing your BIOS is a very simple and straight forward process and nothing to be concerned about.

2: If you're finding that your new pendrive/penstick isn't appearing properly within Windows Explorer? i.e. it's blank, it's got no file size/free space next to it? It just means it's currently an unallocated disk and it needs be allocated before use.

2.1: How to do this? Start > Disk management > Create and Format Hard disk partitions > right click your pen drive > new simple volume > FAT32 > you're done.

3: Where would I find get the latest version of my BIOS from? Your manfacuterers website, such as: https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-crosshair/rog-crosshair-x870e-apex/helpdesk_bios/ > Downloada the files > drag into your pen drive and then restart!

4: Head into your bios and find the Instant flash, ez flash or flash button located in your BIOS settings, it will look something like this:

5: Once you're here, click the "EZ Flash Utility" > Select the file and wait.

>ONCE THE UPDATE STARTS, LET IT RUN IT'S COURSE. DO NOT POWER OFF, DO NOT WORRY, JUST LET IT DO IT'S THING. IT WILL EVENTUALLY RESTART.
