# Why is this chapter even here?

I kid you not, half of the computers out there have something wrong with them and the person using them doesn't even know. 90% of the consultations done by Optimisers in the modern day, don't even involve overclocking, it involves resolving an issue on their PC that they didn't even know about. I've done a handful of consults and throughout that time, more often than not, it's just that there is something horrendously wrong with the computer and it's usually a quick and easy fix.

The PC has to be in a functional state before you can actually tune it, which seems like common sense but you would be surprised. This is one of the reasons why 99.99% of consults that people do are on FRESH Windows Installations.

So the goal of this Chapter 1 module from start to finish is to go through everything just to make sure everything is working as it should before we even get to the tuning part. This would be the most "valuable" chapter throughout this whole entire course if I were charging for it but because I'm not a scumbag, snake-oil salesman? I'm not going to do that. 

After this, you're going to be the one who your friends are going to come to for help. 

So let's get started.
